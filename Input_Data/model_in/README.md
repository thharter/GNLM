This folder contains the code that is used to read the main input file which was named "model_input.asc"
However neither the model_input.asc file or model_input.mat (the actual matlab binary input) will be uploaded in this repo.
You can find these files in the google drive https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B3lC_neIrxHvTTcxWmY3OXFtUk0
